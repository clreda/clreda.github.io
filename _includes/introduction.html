<p>I am interested in bioinformatics and machine learning to apply tractable and understandable methods to extract higher-order, causal, information from biological data.</p>
<p>My research journey led me to consider several aspects of drug development and repurposing, and got me acclimated to working in an interdisciplinary environment. Here are three of my proudest works:</p>

    <p>Enforcing an explicit connection between features and classification scores allows us to <b>enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms</b>, for instance in drug repurposing</p>

    <p>I have designed an approach which incorporates regulatory cascades and disease-specific transcriptomic information to detect <b>master regulators</b>, which can be targeted to treat a disease</p>

          <img src="/assets/repurposing.png" width="200" height="100"></img>
    <p>Drug repurposing can be seen as a Top-<i>m</i> identification problem in bandits. One challenge is to <b>exploit side information about the drugs</b> to decrease the number of tests</p>
