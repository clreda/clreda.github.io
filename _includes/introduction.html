<p>I am a Computer Science PhD student in Genetics at the <b>Integrative Genomics</b> group in the Neurodiderot unit of Inserm (<i>French institute for medical research</i>) (Paris 19, France) since September 2019. I am mainly interested in bioinformatics, and how to apply tractable and understandable methods to extract higher-order information from biological data.</p>
