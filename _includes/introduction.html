<p>I am a PhD student in Genetics at <b>Inserm Neurodiderot</b> (<i>French institute for medical research</i>) & at <b>Inria SCOOL</b> (<i>French institute for Computer Science and Automation</i>) since September 2019.</p> 

<p>I am mainly interested in bioinformatics and (supervised, sequential) machine learning, and how to apply tractable and understandable methods to extract higher-order, causal, information from biological data. My research journey led me to consider several aspects of drug development and repurposing, and got me acclimated to working in an interdisciplinary environment. </p>
